W12:
---TIME:
I spent 4 hours working in my Python program

---ORGANIZATION:
My program is organized in multiple functions and each function perform just one task

---PROGRESS:
Yes, I completed significant part of the program. Last week I just watched videos and practiced, so I created all the progress this week.

---DESCRIPTION:
FUNCTION NAMES: creates_dataframe, select_5_first_rows, select_last_5_rows, select_column

TEST FUNCTIONS: I didn't create test functions yet. I will finish all the program in the first days of w13 and then go for the test functions.

DOCUMENTATION: I'm only taking a Linkedin Learning course about data visualization in order to create my program (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-for-data-visualization).
If I face problems or specific errors, I google it or search in stackoverflow, but my main learning source is the Linkedin course

LIST OF THE WORK:
- I created all the program from 0
- Created all listed functions, each with their description and try except blocks
- Created the main function with part of the user interface

---COMMENTS:
I changed the name of the program to TABLE FROM CSV. 
Answering last week's feedback, my program will take the data from a .csv file. The user can enter his own .csv and the program will look for it in the same directory. In my example, I'm using a car financing data file.

The program will let the user do multiple things with their csv file like: 
veryfing the list by printing X first and X last rows  
selecting a specific row to show, the user can specify indexes
print the whole table (developing)
filtering (developing)
renaming and deleting columns(developing)

The program will run the code for each specific task and print in console the results from the datafram in a table style.
