<h3>Hello! I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natanael-damatta/">Natanael</a></h3>
Please, feel free to make a pull request (changes) if you consider that there is something to update or improve. I tried to do my best and be as tidy as possible.<br>

<b>DISCLAIMER:</b><br>
• Follow your instructor's advices in EVERY assignment. Before checking for something here, go and ask help to your classmates. They're really cool and are always willing to help<br> 
• I <strong>DON'T</strong> encourage cheating on assignments, if you are really doing the course it is to learn, and these assignments help you a lot with that.<br>
• I <strong>REJECT</strong> any charge of encouraging students to cheat, knowing that it is against <a href="https://dfkpq46c1l9o7.cloudfront.net/pdfs/148e250c14f5be811f0c42353b9d46dc.pdf">BYU's Honor Code.</a><br>
• This repo has the purpose of, if any student feels stuck in a task, he can have an idea of what steps to take and how the operation is carried out.<br>

This course helped me to realize how much I like programming, and I hope it does the same for you. Try your best to learn, understand, and complete the assignments. It will be a solid foundation for following courses.
This is an inspired course from the Church. All the instructors try their best to help us to learn and achieve our goals.

Thanks for reading!<br>
