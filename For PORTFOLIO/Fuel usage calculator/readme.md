This program is designed to calculate and display the fuel efficiency of a vehicle based on user-provided odometer readings and fuel consumption.<br>
It defines two functions: <i>miles_per_gallon()</i> to calculate miles per <i>gallon and lp100k_from_mpg()</i> to convert miles per gallon to liters per 100 kilometers.<br>
The main function drives the program's execution by gathering user input, performing calculations, and displaying the results.
