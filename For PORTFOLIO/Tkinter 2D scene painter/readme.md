This program focuses on health-related calculations such as age, unit conversion, body mass index (BMI), and basal metabolic rate (BMR).<br>
<br>
The program gathers user input and applies the necessary functions to perform the calculations.<br>
It demonstrates my ability to handle user input, implement calculations, and organize code into functions for improved readability and modularity.
