This program uses the Draw 2-D library to create a visual scene with a sky, clouds, and a sun above a ground.<br>
It defines functions to draw different elements of the scene, such as the sky, clouds, ground, and sun. The main function does the drawing process by calling the rest of the functions and setting up the canvas.<br>
This program demonstrates my ability to use library functions to create graphical scenes.
