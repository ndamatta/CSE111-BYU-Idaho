This code utilizes the Draw 2-D library to create a visual scene with a sky, clouds, and a sun above a ground.<br>
It defines functions to draw different elements of the scene, such as the sky, clouds, ground, and sun. The main function orchestrates the drawing process by calling these functions and setting up the canvas.<br>
The code demonstrates my ability to use library functions to create graphical scenes.
